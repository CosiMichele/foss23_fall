Certainly! Here are four examples of assessments for watershed health related to geomorphology, water quality, and species diversity presented in a markdown table:

| Assessment Type            | Parameters Assessed             | Methods and Tools                            |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Geomorphological Assessment | 1. Streambank Erosion          | - Streambank surveys and measurements       |
|                            | 2. Sediment Transport          | - Sediment sampling and analysis             |
|                            | 3. Channel Stability          | - Cross-section surveys and GIS analysis     |
|                            | 4. Watershed Topography       | - Topographic mapping and remote sensing     |
| Water Quality Assessment   | 1. Nutrient Levels            | - Water sampling and laboratory analysis    |
|                            | 2. Contaminant Presence       | - Chemical analysis and pollutant tracking  |
|                            | 3. pH and Dissolved Oxygen    | - Field measurements and water quality probes|
|                            | 4. Temperature Variability    | - Continuous monitoring and data loggers    |
| Species Diversity Assessment| 1. Aquatic Biodiversity      | - Biological surveys and taxonomic studies  |
|                            | 2. Riparian Habitat Quality   | - Vegetation surveys and habitat assessment |
|                            | 3. Endangered Species Presence| - Species-specific surveys and monitoring  |
|                            | 4. Invasive Species Invasion  | - Invasive species tracking and management   |

These assessments help evaluate the overall health and integrity of a watershed, taking into account geomorphological, water quality, and ecological factors.
